/**
 *    Job assignment:
 *    Create function that will take one parameter - a sentence - and will return the same sentence but some letters will be swapped.
 *    There is only one rule: First and Last letter in every word needs to be correctly placed - all other letters can be shuffled.
 *
 *    Example input:    "Reading swapped words"
 *    Example output:   "Raeding sawpped wrods"
 *
 *    How it works? Read here:
