## How to begin:

**Video-tutorial with slovak speaker is available here: https://youtu.be/X1jl_gb8fT4**

1) install **Intellij Idea Ultimate IDE**:  
 **https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/**  
This is the software where we will develop our applications. 
However this is a payed product but you can get a free license as a student:  
https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students  
Alternatively you can download free Ultimate EAP version (early access version that can contains bugs, but it's good enough) here:  
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/  
**Make sure to download Ultimate version!**

2) install **Git**  
**https://git-scm.com/download/win**

3) install **Node.js**  
**https://nodejs.org/en/download/**

4) install **Python**  
**https://www.python.org/downloads/**

4) make sure you have Firefox or Chrome web-browser - we will be using **Firefox Developer Edition**  
**https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/**

5) open installed **Git** console and type:

```console
    mkdir git
    cd git
    git clone https://github.com/icl7126/programovanie_obchodna_akademia.git
```
After these steps you will have all your files in your PC and you can start developing using **Intellij Idea** by opening the cloned directory.
